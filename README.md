# Turborepo Design System Starter

This guide explains how to use a React design system starter powered by:

- 🏎 [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) — High-performance build system for Monorepos
- 🚀 [React](https://reactjs.org/) — JavaScript library for user interfaces
- 🛠 [Tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) — TypeScript bundler powered by esbuild
- 📖 [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) — UI component environment powered by Vite

As well as a few others tools preconfigured:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versioning and changelogs
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/changesets/action) for fully automated package publishing

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest -e design-system
```

### Useful Commands

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages, including the Storybook site
- `pnpm dev` - Run all packages locally and preview with Storybook
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
- `pnpm changeset` - Generate a changeset
- `pnpm clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)

### Compilation

To make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.

Running `pnpm build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.

For `acme-core`, the `build` command is the following:

```bash
tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react
```

`tsup` compiles `src/index.tsx`, which exports all of the components in the design system, into both ES Modules and CommonJS formats as well as their TypeScript types. The `package.json` for `acme-core` then instructs the consumer to select the correct format:

```json:acme-core/package.json
{
  "name": "@acme/core",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "module": "./dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "sideEffects": false,
}
```

Run `pnpm build` to confirm compilation is working correctly. You should see a folder `acme-core/dist` which contains the compiled output.

```bash
acme-core
└── dist
    ├── index.d.ts  <-- Types
    ├── index.js    <-- CommonJS version
    └── index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
```

### Releasing

When you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash
turbo run build --filter=docs^... && changeset publish
```

Turborepo runs the `build` script for all publishable packages (excluding docs) and publishes the packages to npm. By default, this example includes `acme` as the npm organization. To change this, do the following:

- Rename folders in `packages/*` to replace `acme` with your desired scope
- Search and replace `acme` with your desired scope
- Re-run `pnpm install`

To publish packages to a private npm organization scope, **remove** the following from each of the `package.json`'s

```diff
- "publishConfig": {
-  "access": "public"
- },
```
